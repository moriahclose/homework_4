 * To determine a win condition, each square is "tagged"
 * from left to right, top to bottom, with successive
 * powers of 2.  Each cell thus represents an individual
 * bit in a 9-bit string, and a player's squares at any
 * given time can be represented as a unique 9-bit value.
 * A winner can thus be easily determined by checking
 * whether the player's current 9 bits have covered any
 * of the eight "three-in-a-row" combinations.
